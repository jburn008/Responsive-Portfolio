                        <p>The pieces of paper which I paid colleges money to get would tell you that I am proficient in finance,
                            operations management, and economics. What does that mean? Well, I invest as a hobby. I tried
                            to work for Merrill Lynch right out of undergrad but there was a great recession - you may have
                            heard of it. The numbers speak to me. A definitive way to look at information and patterns. And
                            what about the Master's in Operations Management? Well, that just means that I can breakdown
                            a project into small digestible pieces.</p>
                        <p class="clearfix">Are you still reading this? Ok, so more about me. I like dogs, dark chocolate, and a good pizza but
                            not all at the same time. I am taking web development for a lot of reasons but principal among
                            them is so I can build a user inferface to test a business idea. Since I have several years of
                            "real world" work experience, I also want to diversify my skillset. I have seen first hand the
                            consumer goods industry shift to a more digital first environment. If people that sell chips
                            and soda are saying 'we have to go digital' then I think it will be table stakes in the years
                            ahead across many industries.</p>
